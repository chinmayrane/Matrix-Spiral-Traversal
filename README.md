# Matrix-Spiral-Traversal

Enter a Matrix of M Rows X N Columns.

Example : 5 X 5 Matrix

int a[4][4] = {

	{3, 7, 8, 1, 7},
	
	{5, 4, 2, 6, 9},
	
	{9, 3, 4, 7, 3},
	
	{1, 5, 2, 6, 8},
	
	{4, 8, 2, 1, 5}

};

This should output

3, 7, 8, 1, 7, 9, 3, 8, 5, 1, 2, 8, 4, 1, 9, 5, 4, 2, 6, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4

As it traverses the matrix in the spiral manner

Time Complexity:  O( M X N)
Space Complexity: Constant
